# Code for Norway 🇳🇴

## Civic Technology for a Stronger, More Inclusive Norway

**Code for Norway** is a non-profit civic technology initiative focused on developing open-source digital tools that address societal challenges across the country.
The initiative brings together a diverse group of developers, designers, public servants, students, activists, and citizens to co-create digital services with real-world impact.

## Digital Innovation for the Public Good

Inspired by global civic tech movements, Code for Norway aims to improve the relationship between people and public institutions through accessible and transparent digital solutions.

The Code for Norway initiative is:

* **open to all contributors**: Any developer, designer, student, or citizen with a civic mindset is welcome to participate.
* **designed for real needs**: Projects address social and local challenges in Norwegian communities.
* **driven by community**: Solutions are developed collaboratively, in the open, and under permissive open-source licenses.

By empowering citizens with technology, we promote transparency, inclusion, and participation in public life.

## Architecture and Project Framework

Since its founding, Code for Norway has emphasized building a flexible, scalable and community-driven technical foundation for civic innovation.

Each project under the organization adheres to the following principles:

* Modular and reusable architecture
* Free and open-source software
* Inclusive and human-centered design
* Compatibility with public infrastructure when applicable

The organization currently maintains several repositories, including experimental projects, reference applications, and public infrastructure tools.

## ⭐ Featured Project – Help Map

![Help Map](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d539bc3-9ee4-4b20-a374-f51e88e7851f)

**Help Map** is an interactive, community-powered platform that connects people in need with essential services such as food, clothing, and emergency shelter.

The project demonstrates the potential of civic technology to reduce inequality and improve access to local support services across Norwegian cities and towns.

The Help Map platform provides:

* 🗺️ Visual, location-based service listings
* 👥 Community-driven data input and updates
* 📱 Mobile-first, inclusive user experience
* ⚡ Real-time data synchronization and open data accessibility
